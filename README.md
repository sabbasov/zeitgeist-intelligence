# 🌑 ZEITGEIST INTELLIGENCE

> **Extracting the spirit of the team. Liquidating communication debt.**

ZEITGEIST is a high-fidelity intelligence engine designed to turn chaotic chat logs (Slack, Discord, iMessage) into actionable executive summaries. Built with an Obsidian-grade aesthetic and a zero-retention privacy protocol.
